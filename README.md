**Project Objective:** Students will understand the industry context that can motivate PCA/CCA/Low Rank Approximations. Students will explore the intricacies of SVD in the context of PCA to better understand the algorithm. Students will also become familiar with data cleaning methodologies, and will be introduced to more formal data processing techniques, including replacing NaNs and one-hot-encoding.

**Navigating the Repository:** There are several important files in the repository. You should first review the slides "CCA_PCA Slides.pdf" and the notes "###" to ensure you have a basic conceptual understanding of the topics to be covered in the main notebook. Don't worry if you are not comfortable with everything; the notebook will certainly help with that. Next, complete the Jupyter Notebook titled "Baseball Data Processing.ipynb". Once you have completed all code cells to the best of your ability, your next task is to finish the quiz titled "AWGSJ_quiz.ipynb".
